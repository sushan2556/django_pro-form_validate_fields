What is API (Application Programming INteface)
It is an interface that allows two programs/softares to interface between them

End user <--> Our application <--> API <--> YOUtube
with the help of APi, our software is trying to communnicate with Youtube 

when we try to send data to api, it is sent in the format of Json file . It is one type of data format.
The return response will also be in Json format

with help of JSON , independent communication is done and data is tranfer using Json 

There are many sites which provide Api for us , we will call this API and they will provide the data for us 

HTTP Methods - GET, PUT, DELETE , POST, GET

Identify Resources - which API we will be needing , which all resource we will be using 

End Points - What all will be the end points 

/companies         --   GET     -- this method with get all company details 
/companies/ID      --   GET     -- This will get single company ID 
/companies/ID      --   PUT     -- This will Update company ID
/companies/ID      --   DELETE  -- This will delete company ID
/companies         --   POST    -- Create new company 
/companies/ID/emp  --   GET     -- Get all employee of company ID

Above , some urls are same. Important is HTTP method that is used, which identify which method needs to be use
when we call API, we share some methods with it 

our response will be sent using Json file, and we will recieve the response in Json format 
Our API will always respond in Json 
this is called Rest APIs

End points for employee - 

/Employees         --   GET     -- this method with get all employees details 
/Employees/ID      --   GET     -- This will get single employees ID 
/Employees/ID      --   PUT     -- This will Update employees ID
/Employees/ID      --   DELETE  -- This will delete employees ID
/Employees         --   POST    -- Create new employees 

We will need Python, Django and Django rest framework(DRF)
Serializer - they will convert data into Json and convert data from json to object
Views - to accept request 
Setup URLS - which view function to work , mapping is done 
test your api - browser and Postman

Nesting in two Resources -
